# Anecdotes app

An application where I learnt how to use Redux as a state management. The application is a simple front-end app with a mock database by using json-server.

With the app, users add, filter and vote for anecdotes.

## Tech-Stack

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux**: A state manager that supports consistent behaviors of states.

## Setup

You can clone the project by using the following commands in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/huongtxdo/anecdotes-redux.git anecdotes
cd anecdotes
npm install
npm start
```

and in a second terminal:

```
cd anecdotes
npm run server
```
